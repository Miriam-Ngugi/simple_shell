# Simple shell README<br>
## Description:<br> 
SimpleShell is a lightweight and user-friendly shell implementation for Unix-like operating systems. <br>
It provides a simple command-line interface for executing basic shell commands, such as navigating directories, creating and deleting files, and running external programs.<br>
SimpleShell is designed to be easy to use and to provide a minimal set of features for users who prefer a more straightforward shell experience.<br>
<br>
To compile and run a C program using GCC, follow these steps:
<br>
1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where your C source code file is located.<br>
2. Type the following command to compile your source code file:<br>
`gcc -o program_name *.c`<br>
* Replace "program_name" with the name you want to give to your executable file. The asterisk (*) symbol means that all C files in the current directory will be compiled together.<br>
3. Press Enter to execute the command. If there are no errors, GCC will create an executable file with the name you specified in step 2.<br>
4. To run your program, type the following command in the terminal:<br>
`./program_name`<br>
* Replace "program_name" with the name you gave to your executable file in step 2.<br>
5. Press Enter to execute the command. Your program will now run in the terminal window.<br>
<br>
That's it! By following these steps, you can easily compile and run a C program using GCC.<br><br>
